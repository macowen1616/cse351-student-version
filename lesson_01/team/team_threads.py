Course: CSE 351
Lesson: L01 Team Activity
File:   team.py
Author: <Add name here>
Purpose: Find prime numbers

Instructions:

- Don't include any other Python packages or modules
- Review and follow the team activity instructions (team.md)

TODO 1) Get this program running.  Get cse351 package installed
TODO 2) move the following for loop into 1 thread
TODO 3) change the program to divide the for loop into 10 threads
TODO 4) change range_count to 100007.  Does your program still work?  Can you fix it?
Question: if the number of threads and range_count was random, would your program work?
